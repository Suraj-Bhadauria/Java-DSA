<h1> JAVA + DSA Notes </h1>
<ul>
  <li> These are topic wise notes.</li>
  <li>These are created in my own personal format, i.e. only copying from vsCode to pasting here in the file, named by it.</li>
  <li>Studied from DSA Bootcamp. A big shoutout to [Kunal Kushwaha](https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha)</li>
